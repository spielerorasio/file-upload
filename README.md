# file-upload
spring boot file-upload example - save file in the db


based on https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files/
modified a bit to work with postgres anf JPA
a better example should have been actually saving to a file/storage repository

to tun this excample create postgres schema called file-upload 
and access http://localhost:9999
